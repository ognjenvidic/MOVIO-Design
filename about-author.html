						<h4 class="w-100 text-bronze">Ognjen Vidić 149/19</h4>
						<p>I am Ognjen Vidić born on November 18 2000, in Valjevo. My educational journey began at Prva Osnovna Škola, followed by the Technical School in Valjevo, where I specialized in Computer Network Administration as part of an experimental program. After completing my secondary education, I relocated to Belgrade to pursue higher studies at the ICT College, majoring in Internet Technologies. This decision allowed me to deepen my knowledge and skills in computer networks, server infrastructures, virtualization, cloud computing, and related fields.</p>
						<p>I discovered ICT College through a professor who occasionally visited my high school to introduce the programs offered by the institution. After learning about the college's modules, I was certain that studying IT and network administration was the perfect path for me.</p>
						<p>During my studies at ICT College, I earned the MTCNA certification and completed the comprehensive CCNA course, with plans to officially obtain the certification shortly.</p>
						<p>For nearly three years, I have been employed at Trony Network, a company specializing in outsourced IT services for various businesses. In Serbia, we work with Domaća Trgovina DOO, where I play a key role in managing the company's entire IT sector. This includes overseeing servers, databases, ERP systems, and all IT equipment.</p>	
						<p>This position represents my first professional role in the IT industry. Before joining Trony Network, I worked independently on small-scale IT projects. Additionally, after moving to Belgrade, I took on various non-IT jobs to support my education.</p>	
						<p>My passion for computers began in my childhood, initially sparked by gaming. I built my first computers independently, which fueled my interest in computer hardware. This passion led me to choose Computer Network Administration in high school, where I gained foundational knowledge in networking and other aspects of IT, such as programming basics, database management, and computer hardware/software.</p>
